It is build on the microservices architeture and utilises the Spring Boot and Spring Cloud liberies. The Spring Cloud adds integration for many useful tools in a service-oriented environment. Some are Spring projects, like the Config Server. Some leverage battle tested open source components like Netflix Eureka, Zuul and Hystrix.

For the persistence, was desire to meet the ACID criteria - Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable. 
MySQL holds most of the data in production. Yet, migrating the analytical datastore to PostgreSQL is already underway as tests show it to be a better fit for the models and tooling.
