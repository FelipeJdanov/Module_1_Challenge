## Overview and Origin

 Wise (Former Transferwise), a foreign exchange financial technology company, was founded in 2011 by Kristo Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus. The company's founders had the practice of transferring money internationally, until the moment, only using the banks in which they had accounts. Frustrated with expensive fees, both decided they could improve the flow of the financial foreign exchange with better exchange rates. </br>
 With the initial funding of  $1.3 million from a consortium, the company grow fast being named one of Seedcamp 2011's winners. After progressive growth and subsequent major investments, the company reached a total value of $5 billion in 2020. At the moment, Wise is funded by 37 investors. Silicon Valley Bank UK and Silicon Valley Bank UK are the most recent investors.
