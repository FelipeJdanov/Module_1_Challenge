To build the frontend, Wise uses Bower and NPM for dependency management. Grunt automates the builds. Jasmine and Protractor power the tests and Karma + PhantomJS run the tests. There’s also Webpack and Babel doing their part. Some parts of the code already use TypeScript.

Traditionally, the costs of securely organising and transferring money globally have been relatively high. The rise in digitisation and automation reduced remittance cost and transfer time, and increased adoption of banking and financial services are driving the growth of the digital remittance market with the help of the internet.<br/>
The remittance industry offers many opportunities for digital transformation and innovation. The rapid adoption of mobile phones, internet, and digital platforms has enabled new ways of sending and receiving money, such as mobile money, online platforms, e-wallets, and blockchain. These digital channels can reduce the cost, time, and friction of remittances, as well as increase the convenience, security, and transparency. They can also expand the reach and inclusion of remittance customers, especially in rural and remote areas where access to traditional financial services is limited or nonexistent.
